# Signature

## Overview
This project focuses on **signature recognition** using machine learning techniques. It involves training a model to recognize and classify handwritten signatures. The goal is to automate the signature verification process, which can be useful in various applications like document verification, banking, and legal systems.

## Features
- Signature classification and verification
- Preprocessing of handwritten signatures
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics for model accuracy

## Requirements
Before you start using the project, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow` (or any preferred ML framework)
- `opencv-python` (for image processing)
